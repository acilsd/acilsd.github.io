##a very basic webpack boilerplate
###from newfag, for newfags :3
***
####Using:
	$npm install
	
	$npm run wds for webpack-development-sever
	(HMR enabled by default, go to /localhost/your-directory)
	
	$set NODE_ENV=development //default value
	
	$set NODE_END=production for production build
	
	$webpack for a simple build+watch (withour WDS and HMR)

no prepros atm, just a simple modular css

If you need es6+sass/stylus/jade etc u better use gulp, seriously
